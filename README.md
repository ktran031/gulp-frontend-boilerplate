# JohnFajardo: The website
A third attempt at a personal website

## The problem
As a recent bootcamp grad, I need a personal website, but I'm totally broke. I could use GitHub pages, but where's the fun in that? I tried Jekyll on Namecheap but the experience is so clunky it's almost like writing a complete website by hand on each update. So with a Namecheap account and $10 to my name, I decided to make the best with what I have:

* Heroku's free tier goes to sleep after half an hour on inactivity. I want potential employers to load the site FAST.
* Rails+React is a big nono on shared plans.
* Database is limited to MySQL.
* I already have a domain name and a Namecheap account.
* Rails on Namecheap is not possible on their shared plan.

So what CAN I do on a shared plan?
* I can do php.
* I can do MySQL.
* I can use my own domain.

So that leaves one viable candidate: Wordpress. Love it or hate it, it's here to stay, it powers a huge portion of the internet and I had a kick with it back in college doing crappy websites for local businesses. Besides, I hadn't touched php in years so this will be fun. I also just about had it with Bootstrap, so this time I'm only using plain old SCSS.

This would be v3 of my website. There is a previously unpublished V2 running perfectly fine on my box, but it uses Bootstrap so I've never been happy with it.
